Flexiport
=========

Flexible communications library.

Flexiport provides a consistent interface for communicating over a range of
data port types. Currently serial (including serial-over-USB), TCP and UDP
ports are supported. Logging is possible, which allows communications sessions
to be played back at a later date without the original hardware present.
