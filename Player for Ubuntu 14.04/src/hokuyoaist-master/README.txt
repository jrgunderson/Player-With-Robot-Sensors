==========

Hokuyo range sensor driver.

This library provides a driver for Hokuyo laser scanner devices using
the SCIP protocol version 1 or 2. It has been tested with the Hokuyo
URG-04LX, UBG-04LX, UHG-08LX, UTM-30LX and UXM-30LX-E but it should work
with any scanner that conforms to these protocol versions, including the
URG-04LX-F01 and the URG-04LX-UG01 (Simple-URG).
