Scenario 1 (Full Autonomy â€“ No Error):
Have two robots pushing the box successfully to the goal. No failure introduced.

Scenario 2 (Teleoperation):
Have two robots pushing the box first and then simulate a failure on one of the robots, the operator is then going to teleoperate the failed robot to help push the box with the other robot.

Scenario 3 (P2P): 
Same as before, but the operator physically joins the functioning robot to push the box to the goal location.

Scenario 4 (System Initiative):
Same as before, but the operator is not going to join the team.  After a set time, the non-failed robot will realize it will receive no help and push the box the remainder of the way on its own.

Scenario 5 (Mixed Initiative):
Same as before, where robot will decide to push box on its own. Then after some time (probably after the robot pushes each side of the box once) the operator will interrupt and join the mission to help complete the task with the robot.  This scenario is showing how the sliding autonomy works under various situations.

* All scenarios, will have the same starting point, goal point, and failure point.

Variables to measure: 
- total task time, 
- workload (total human_user time)
- success rate (successful trails/total trials)
