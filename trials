For all scenarios, run them with the same starting point, goal point, and failure point.

Scenario 1 (Full Autonomy â€“ No Error):
Have two robots pushing the box successfully to the goal. No failure introduced.

Scenario 2 (Teleoperation):
Have two robots pushing the box first and then simulate a failure on one of the robots, the operator is then going to teleoperate the failed robot to help push the box with the other robot.

Scenario 3 (P2P): 
Same as before, but the operator physically joins the functioning robot to push the box to the goal location.

Scenario 4 (System Initiative):
Same as before, but the operator is not going to join the team.  After a set time, the non-failed robot will realize it will receive no help and push the box the remainder of the way on its own.

Scenario 5 (Mixed Initiative):
Same as before, but the operator decides to have one robot pushing instead b/c he is busy; then the operator can interrupt and join the mission to help complete the task with the robot. 
This scenario is showing how the sliding autonomy works under various situations.


measure: total task time, workload (total human_user time), success rate (successful trails/total trials).
